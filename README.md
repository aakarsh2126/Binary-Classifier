# Binary-Classifier
A Convolutional Neural Network to classify a image in 2 classes with accuracy over 86 percent over training set and 83 percent accuracy over test set.
 ## Libraries Required
1. Keras
2. numpy
3. Pickle
## Convolutional Neural Network
The convolutional network(CNN) is a feed forward network applied to image data.Here Inputs are image's 3d matrix.So,basically our objective is to find patterns and trends in similar type of images and classify them as in the same class.
## Steps in Convolutional Neural Network
### Convolutional 
### Pooling
### Flattening
### Creating a full layered Artificial Neural Network
